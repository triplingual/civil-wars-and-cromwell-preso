					<h2>A Note on Terminology</h2>
					<p>
						I find it extremely interesting the sleight-of-hand with which this time of English history has been periodized. Even acknowledging the porosity of historical and geopolicial boundaries, a porosity that — to be fair — doesn't condense easily to the few words required of a textbook title, the time of civil wars, Commonwealth, Protectorate, and Convention disrupts a seamless notion of "Stuart England". My read is that Lockyer is a Royalist sympathizer (by which I mean he is anti-Cromwell). Then again, this is probably mostly just a case of history being written by the victors. In a rough parallel, here in the US, we describe our major war of the 1860s as being within a country rather than between two self-determined nations.

						<h2>Selective Chronology</h2>
						<p>
							What's the dehydrated timeline? (But timeline of what?)
						</p>
						<p>
							Mini version of big ideas sections, so: War, Politics, Church, Freedom
						</p>
						<p>
							Part of the problem of Lockyer shows up really well here, which is that he doesn't go into much detail on the lives of average people. So while I'm periodizing based

						<h1>Nation-State</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							By which I mean the consensus of what sort of state England was during this time. The best way I found to figure this was to consider the layers and topics that I'm using in general to structure this presentation.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Last Years of Charles I</h2>
						<p>
							It seems fair to consider (as Lockyer implicitly does) England unchanged as a state from the onset of hostilities on August 22, 1642 to the execution of Charles I on January 30, 1649.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Commonwealth</h2>
						<p>
							At its longest, it lasted from the execution of Charles I in January of 1649 until the Restoration in 1660
						</p>
						<p>
							At its shortest, it lasted from a Parliamentary declaration creating it on July 5, 1650 until August 4, 1654 when Cromwell dismisses the Rump Parliament
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							What was it? Who established it? Why? Who opposed it? Why?
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Protectorate</h2>
						<p>
							Created when Cromwell dismisses the Rump Parliament and unilaterally accepts [] Lambert's _Instrument of Government_, giving himself the top job of the Commonwealth (see how the Commonwealth didn't end?) of England, Scotland, and Ireland, ends when his son abdicates the title on May 7, 1659.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Restoration</h2>
						<p>
							Naturally, it wasn't quite that simple.
						</p>
						<p>
							 <img src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmujyteg0Q1qbir6lo1_500.gif" align="right" />After Richard Cromwell abdicated, someone had to be in charge. At this time, it was the Council of Officers of the New Model Army (and Lockyer pretty much ignores that the NMA is still here and still taking names) running the show. They "invited" (Lockyer, 375) members of the Rump Parliament to re-form, which they did, sorta, meaning that the government became the Council of Officers plus a tiny Parliament, sufficiently composed of members of the original Rump Parliament that Lockyer calls is the Rump. Hijinks ensue when Parliament dismisses the head of the Council of Officers, which turns around and forcibly dismisses Parliament. Someone(?) forms a Committee of Safety (is the Council of Officers still in effect?), which takes charge of governing. The NMA cleaves, with part supporting the Committee of Safety and part backing Monck's aim of restoring the monarchy. Council of Officers sees it's cornered and dissolves the Committee of Safety ca. Christmas 1659, leaving the Rump Parliament in charge. Rump welcomes Monck, who invites Prides'-Purge-ed survivors back into Parliament. This reconstituted Long Parliament dissolves itself, and a Convention Parliament (or just a Convention) is elected. The Convention formally requests Charles II to return and proclaims him King of England. Exeunt.

							<li>February 21, 1660 &#8211; March 16, 1660
						</ol>
						<aside class="notes">
							So named because it can be considered to have existed from November 1640 to March 1660. Lockyer sees it as interrupted by the Rump Parliament and the Protectorate Parliaments.

							1. Called by Charles I, ends the day before hostilities
							2. Begins the day hostilities start, ends the day before Pride's Purge
							3. Begins when Monck re-invites those purged by Pride, dissolves itself after establishing a national church, setting up Monck as commander-in-chief, and returning militia control to localities. (377)

							Charles, in an attempt to set up a shadow government (or perhaps to turn the London-based government into a shadow), calls for the elected MPs to convene in Oxford, where the monarchy-in-exile has alighted.

					<h2>War</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>First Civil War: August 22, 1642 — May 5, 1646 (3.75 years of major hostilities, remembering that there was no fighting in the winter months; during this time, combatants may have simply returned home, depending on their ability to do so)</li>
						<li>Second Civil War: May – August 1648 (Parliament's supporters in Kent, Essex, Wales took up arms for Charles, so great was their discontent with Parliament; key issues were soldiers' intolerable behavior [rape, theft, quartering] and excise that Parliament imposed to pay for war) </li>
						<li>Third Civil War: February 8, 1649 — September 3, 1651 (Scots, angry that Parliament executed Charles, proclaim Charles II king of Scotland, raise an army, and attack England/Parliament)</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Fighting</h2>
						<p>
							What's an army? Who fights where for whom and for what? What are the national, regional, local boundaries of armed conflict and military obligation? What do soldiers fight for, and what do they get in return?
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Before New Model Army</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Who fights?</li>
							<li>Why?</li>
							<li>What's their reward? (What's punishment for not fighting?)</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Lockyer asserts the answer to questions of motivation differs for commons soldiers and elites who commanded. Commoners fought, he claims, for "pay and the chance of plunder, as well as traditional loyalties". (342) I find this to be simplistic and dismissive, but Lockyer doesn't give enough information to build an informed counter-argument and I'm trying to stick here to Lockyer's text.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>New Model Army</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Who founds? Why?</li>
							<li>Who fights? Why?</li>
							<li>Does it achieve its goals? (Spoiler alert: Achieves Parliament's goals, then develops a life of its own.)</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Who founds: Parliament, though technically it was the Committee of Both Kingdoms, a Parliament group who actually ran the war effort. Note that Parliament passed the Self-Denying Ordinance first, removing the offending nobility from commands. Note even more that Oliver Cromwell represented Cambridge as their MP, and never resigned that seat. Parliament made four exceptions to the SDO, including Cromwell.
							Why founded: This was serious business, but also before the point of no return, which turned out to be executing Charles I. Opinions of how to prosecute the war ranged, and two of those strongly suspected to prefer a peaceful solution commanded troops. As half-hearted commanders rarely win battles, Parliament wanted them gone, never to return.
							Who fights: Predominantly veterans of previous wars. Nominally, the NMA contained 22,000 men in cavalry and infantry. (I'm simplifying a bit, as this is not the most important part.) Many were impressed into service, and large numbers were puritans of particularly strong views -- Independents, who favored no central church at all.
							Does it achieve its goals: Hells yes, and then some. Goes rather farther than Parliament wants, perhaps.

							I continue to find new ways to be surprised at Lockyer's downplaying of the New Model Army. For instance, if you were from Sussex county and joined the New Model Army, you could conceivably (given my current limited knowledge) have traveled as far as Ireland and Scotland in your service. I'm likely rear-projecting too much, but that kind of expanded worldview changed political acting in the United States after World War I and World War II, so I'd be surprised if it didn't alter popular behavior of veterans in Early Modern England. By the same token, the state's construction restricted avenues of political participation differently, so I don't mean that behavior altered in the same way.
						</aside>

					<section>
						<h2>Soooooo 1659</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Parliament dissolves NMA? It dissolves itself? Monck defeats it and they scatter to the winds?</li>
<li>In any case, England (UK) returns to the older model of local, limited, occasional militias [yes?]</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
<section>
						<h2>So What?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Frankly, I think that Parliament was militarily incredibly far-sighted in creating the NMA, though the monster they unleashed revealed why standing armies were feared and why they continue to be dangerous.</li>

							<li>Partnership with Levellers, showing a political actor outside England's conventional boundaries. Equally interesting is that there had been popular interventions/uprisings before, but not with sufficient support to achieve anything. Levellers showed a way to circumvent the usual need to have support of the traditional nobility. Hastened, perhaps the parity between houses of Parliament. [need Lockyer comfort]</li>

							<li>is there a third or more thing?</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Religion (Churching)</h2>
						<p>
							What should the state church be? Should there be a state church? Are there national boundaries to a church? How are extranational influences restrained? What place does the state have in controlling religious practice? What place does it have in proscribing belief?

						<aside class="notes">
						By 'Ultra' here, I mean Roman Catholic. That is, it's not merely a national church, it's an international one.
But keep in mind that a strong position on a national church didn't necessarily mean a strong position on church governance. Put another way, some (Lockyer quotes one Sir John Holland on p349) considered any church where the power to remove someone from church membership to be a civil matter and some to be a clerical matter, but both of those groups could consider consistent wanting a national church.
Also of importance: Lockyer remarks that independent churches arose and thrived

						<h2>Wait What</h2>
						<p>
						No, the Presbyterians didn't want bishops. But presbyterianism acknowledges and embraces a wide-area governance model, starting with presbyteries at the regional level, with a supra-church hierarchy that agrees upon acceptable practices and dogma for (and of) individual churches. This position occupied the middle ground on this issue during the Civil Wars, Commonwealth, and Protectorate, hence my placement and description.
In addition, the body established by Parliament in the last months before the start of hostilities, the Westminster Assembly of Divines, revised the

						<h2>Political Governing</h2>
						<p>
							How is a government legitimate(d)? Who gets to change the ruler(s)? What constitutes a nation? "L'état, c'est moi," or "Vox populi, vox dei"? Pertinent for many things, not least the 3rd Civil War. If Charles was king of a unified Great Britain as he thought he was, how can one smaller political component of it attack another?

					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Making Flippy Floppy</h2>
						<p>
							I don't really see how someone involved with national politics at the time could have distinguished the situation from anarchy, or at least that's the impression Lockyer gives. Many entities switched sides or shifted active loyalties at one time or another. Welsh soldiers and Monck completely changed sides. Fairfax and other nobles, after ceding their commands, stayed out of the fight. Sir Henry Vane the Younger was the son of a Caroline minister, but stuck by the Roundhead cause the whole time.
						</p>
						<p>
							Note how Lockyer has to use quote marks to disentangle nomenclature: Independents and "Independents", presbyterians and 'Presbyterians' (he uses single quotes, but he's using UK style)
						</p>
<p>Names of the main players, their adherents, and their times:</p>
<ul>
<li>
</li>
</ul>
						<p>
							It's possible to see the Civil Wars, Commonwealth, and Protectorate as simply the transition from the feudal political structures to Modern ones. The Restoration, in this view, was not the end of the transition, but merely a temporary reversal toward the crown, itself undone by the Glorious Revolution later. This, in 1688, settled the matter, as far as we can tell today.
