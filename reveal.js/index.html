							This presentation took a great deal of editing to try to get to something a little less chaotic than Lockyer's text made me feel, a comment I mean with all generosity to Lockyer. That is, I don't mean that these chapters are not well-written but that I think that anyone involved in English national affairs during this time could have been forgiven for seeing the world as utter chaos.

					<h2>Are You Pondering What I'm Pondering?</h2>
					<p>
						Why is this book called <em>Tudor and Stuart England</em>?
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							I don't have an answer for sure, but I think it's a question worth asking ourselves whether this time period's particularity warrants reconsidering the nomenclature. I think it's a small sign of Lockyer's sympathies, but also is it just history being written by the victors?
						</p>
						<p>
							Is it any different from how we in the US describe our major war of the 1860s as being within a country rather than between two self-determined nations?

						<h1 style="color:#553300;">States</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							By which I mean the historical consensus on what sort of state, at a high level, England was during this time.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Monarchy</h2>
						<p>
							August 22, 1642 &#8211; January 30, 1649
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								It seems fair to consider (as Lockyer implicitly does) England unchanged as a state from the onset of hostilities on August 22, 1642 to the execution of Charles I on January 30, 1649.
							</p>
							<p>
								We heard from Ryan last week on the conflicts between Charles I and Parliament, about the increasing intractability of each side, the tumbling toward war. Of course, it's only a motion toward anything in retrospect, which is not a comment on Ryan's presentation. It's another thought that occurred to me regularly in going over this chapter: Since nobody at the time knew what would happen next, what did they think?
							</p>
							<p>
								But in any case, as a state, it remained a monarchy with a Parliament right up until Charles I's trial and execution.
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Commonwealth</h2>
						<p>
							January 30, 1649 &#8211; May 29, 1660?
						</p>
						<p>
							July 1650 &#8211; December 1653?
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								At its broadest, the Commonwealth lasted from Charles I's execution in January 1649 to the Restoration in May 1660.
							</p>
							<p>
								At its narrowest, it lasted from a Parliamentary declaration creating it in July 1650 to Cromwell's dismissal of the Rump Parliament in December 1653.
							</p>
							<p>
								Depends a bit on what we mean by a Commonwealth.
							</p>
							<p>
								[actual question to group] So, what's a Commonwealth?<br />
								[my answer] A Commonwealth is a political entity (in this case it would have to be a country or agglomeration of countries) formed for the good of the people.
							</p>
							<p>
								Even keeping in mind that a Commonwealth isn't necessarily formed <strong>by</strong> the people, was this a Commonwealth? Was it just a monarchy without a hereditary supreme ruler? Was 1649&#8211;1660 just an interregnum?
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Protectorate</h2>
						<p>
							December 1653 &#8211; May 7, 1659
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								This one's a little clearer.
							</p>
							<p>
								It was created when Parliament's moderates staged a coup against the radical members, tied to Cromwell accepting John Lambert's <em>Instrument of Government</em> and giving himself the job of Lord Protector of the Commonwealth (see how the Commonwealth maybe didn't end?) of England, Scotland, and Ireland. (367)
							</p>
							<p>
								It ended when his son, Richard, abdicates the same title on May 7, 1659.
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Restoration</h2>
						<p style="font-size:.6em;">
							After Richard Cromwell abdicated, someone had to be in charge. At this time, it was the Council of Officers of the New Model Army (and Lockyer pretty much ignores that the NMA is still here and still taking names) running the show. They "invited" (Lockyer, 375) members of the Rump Parliament to re-form, which they did, sorta, meaning that the government became the Council of Officers plus a tiny Parliament, sufficiently composed of members of the original Rump Parliament that Lockyer calls it the Rump. Hijinks ensue. Parliament dismisses the head of the Council of Officers, which turns around and forcibly dismisses Parliament. The Council of Officers forms a Committee of Safety, which takes charge of governing. The NMA cleaves, with part supporting the Committee of Safety and part backing Monck's aim of restoring the monarchy. The Council of Officers sees it's cornered and dissolves the Committee of Safety before Christmas 1659, leaving the Rump Parliament in charge. The Rump hails Monck, who invites Prides'-Purge-ed survivors back into Parliament. This reconstituted Long Parliament dissolves itself, and a Convention Parliament (or just a Convention) is elected. The Convention formally requests Charles II to return and proclaims him King of England.
						</p>
						<p>
							Exit, with flourish.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								You don't have to and I'm not going to read this. Suffice it to say that quite a bit happened in the year between Richard Cromwell's abdication and Charles II's coronation.
							</p>
							<p>
								My point is once again that none of these periods, of course, were as simple as I'm presenting them for the sake of compressing the chronology.
							</p>
							<p>
								In almost two years after Oliver Cromwell died there were four Parliaments (and a governing body, called the Committee of Safety, set up by the New Model Army's Council of officers) and three heads of state (and the Council of Officers). Not confidence-inspiring.

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								a/k/a Westminster Parliament (when a competing Parliament existed)
							</p>
							<p>
								So named because it could be considered to have existed from November 1640 to March 1660, though Lockyer seems to see it as formally interrupted by the Rump Parliament and the Protectorate Parliaments.
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Called by Charles I, ends the day before hostilities</li>
								<li>Begins the day hostilities start, ends the day before Pride's Purge.</li>
								<li>Begins when Monck re-invites those purged by Pride, dissolves itself after establishing a national church, setting up Monck as commander-in-chief, and returning militia control to localities. (377)</li>

						<h2>Oxford Parliament</h2>
						<p>
							a/k/a King's Parliament, Mongrel Parliament
						</p>
						<p>
							January 22, 1644 &#8211; March 10, 1645
						</p>
						<p style="margin-top:2em">
							<em>(Is the Long Parliament still around? Yes.)</em>
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Charles, in an attempt to set up a shadow government (or perhaps to turn the London-based government into a shadow), calls for the elected MPs to convene in Oxford, where the monarchy-in-exile has alighted.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Rump Parliament</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>December 7, 1648 &#8211; April 20, 1653</li>

						<p style="margin-top:2em">
							<em>(Is the Long Parliament still around? Yes.)</em>
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							So called because it was a sawed-off end of the Long Parliament,
							created when the "Independents" in the form of Colonel Thomas Pride got rid of all the moderates, at the behest of the New Model Army. Pride also served as a judge in Charles I's trial. He died in 1658, and his body was ordered disinterred and hanged on a gallows after the Restoration. (356)
						</p>
						<p>
							The first iteration ended when disagreement between it and Cromwell over what should succeed it heated up and Cromwell's troops cleared them out. (364)
						</p>
						<p>
							The New Model Army called the second version after Richard Cromwell's abdication but dissolved it after it attempted to dismiss John Lambert, the head of the Council of Officers.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Council of Officers re-established it for the final time when they dissolved their Committee of Safety, but then it ends as a historical term when Monck invited the purgees back, returning Parliament to a pre-Rump state.

						<h2>Barebones' Parliament</h2>
						<p>
							a/k/a Parliament of Saints, Nominated Assembly

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								Got its name from a well-known MP and Independent minister named Praise-God Barbon/Barebones. (English spelling still not standardized at this time.)
							</p>
							<p>
								Formed after Cromwell expelled the Rump, ended when the moderates of Parliament staged a coup by ceding Parliament's authority to Cromwell, after which Cromwell removed the radicals by force.
							</p>
						</aside>

						<h2>Protectorate Parliaments</h2>

						<p>
							<em>(Don't forget the Rump!)</em>
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Lockyer shows both Cromwells as believing in at least a theater of legitimacy, where Parliament represented the people, but not too much. Then again, he also shows strong Parliaments with wills of their own.

								So called because no person was at the time invested with the legal authority to summon a parliament. (377) This description strikes me as a bit odd, as nobody then had the authority before, but there sure were parliaments. Lockyer, with this one phrase, shows his opinion that England had returned to a state properly governed by law.
							</p>
							<p>
								Lockyer also suspiciously uses the passive voice: "Elections then took place." Who ran these elections? Who tallied the votes? Who stood for the seats?

							May – August 1648

						</p>

						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								Parliament's supporters in Kent, Essex, Wales took up arms for Charles, so great was their discontent with Parliament.
							</p>
							<p>
								Key issues were soldiers' intolerable behavior (rape, theft, unreimbursed quartering) and excises that Parliament imposed to pay for war. Note that these were not the grand issues of the day, but rather quotidian concerns not unique to this period. However, they hadn't always resulted in popular armed uprisings.

						<p>
							<em>State: Commonwealth</em>
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Lockyer doesn't call it a Third Civil War, but I like the designation. Scots, angry that Parliament executed their king, proclaim Charles II king of Scotland, raise an army, and, with Charles II at the head, attack England/Parliament. Doesn't go well, Charles II has to escape to France in disguise.

							<ol>
								<li>"Unfortunate country"?</li>
								<li>Somewhere along the line he missed the memo about Cromwell sending thousands of Irish into forced labor in Barbados. There seems to be at least some disagreement over whether the Irish status in Barbados was slavery, and if so whether their sort of slavery was equivalent to African chattel slavery. These discussions are important, but for our purposes today I'm going to leave them hanging.</li>

						<h2>Fighting</h2>
						<p>
							What's an army? Who fights where for whom and for what? What are the national, regional, local boundaries of armed conflict and military obligation? What do soldiers fight for, and what do they get in return?
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Before New Model Army</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Who fights?</li>
							<li>Why?</li>
							<li>What's their reward? (What's punishment for not fighting?)</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Lockyer asserts the answer to questions of motivation differs for commons soldiers and elites who commanded. Commoners fought, he claims, for "pay and the chance of plunder, as well as traditional loyalties". (342) I find this to be simplistic and dismissive, but Lockyer doesn't give enough information to build an informed counter-argument and I'm trying to stick here to Lockyer's text.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>New Model Army</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Who founds? Why?</li>
							<li>Who fights? Why?</li>
							<li>Does it achieve its goals? (Spoiler alert: Achieves Parliament's goals, then develops a life of its own.)</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								Who founds: Parliament, though technically it was the Committee of Both Kingdoms, a Parliament group who actually ran the war effort. Note that Parliament passed the Self-Denying Ordinance virtually simultaneously in 1645, removing wishy-washy nobility from commands. Note even more that Oliver Cromwell represented Cambridge as their MP, and never resigned that seat. Parliament made four exceptions to the SDO, including Cromwell.
							</p>
							<p>
								Why founded: This was serious business, but also before the point of no return, which turned out to be executing Charles I. Opinions of how to prosecute the war ranged, and two of those strongly suspected to prefer a peaceful solution commanded troops. As half-hearted commanders rarely win battles, Parliament wanted them gone, never to return.
							</p>
							<p>
								Who fights: Predominantly veterans of previous wars. Many were impressed into service, and large numbers were puritans of particularly strong views including Independents, who favored no central church at all.
							</p>
							<p>
								Does it achieve its goals: Hells yes, and then some. Goes rather farther than Parliament wants, perhaps.
							</p>
							<p>
								I continue to find new ways to be surprised at Lockyer's downplaying of the New Model Army. For instance, if you were from Sussex county and joined the New Model Army, you could conceivably (given my current limited knowledge) have traveled as far as Ireland and Scotland in your service. I'm likely rear-projecting too much, but that kind of expanded worldview changed political acting in the United States after World War I and World War II, so I'd be surprised if it didn't alter popular behavior of veterans in Early Modern England. By the same token, the state's construction restricted avenues of political participation differently, so I don't mean that behavior altered in the same way.

						<h2>That's Soooooo 1659</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Parliament dissolves NMA? It dissolves itself? Monck defeats it and they scatter to the winds?</li>
							<li>In any case, England (UK) returns to the militia model, with any training, recruitment, and activation in the hands of localities and their designated leaders. (377)</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>So What?</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								Frankly, I think that Parliament was militarily incredibly far-sighted in creating the NMA, though the monster they unleashed revealed why standing armies were feared and why they continue to be dangerous.
							</p>
							<p>
								Partnership with Levellers, showing a political actor outside England's conventional boundaries.
							</p>
							<p>
								This period is not exactly a popular uprising, but it approaches one with the Levellers' power in government via the Army.
							</p>
							<p>
								Spoiler Alert: I looked ahead a bit and saw that Charles II retains a small royal standing army, which speaks to the ripples of the NMA.

						<h2>Religion (Churching)</h2>
						<p>
							What should the state church be? Should there be a state church? Are there national boundaries to a church? How are extranational influences restrained? What place does the state have in controlling religious practice? What place does it have in prescribing or proscribing belief?

							<ul>
								<li>By 'Ultra' here, I mean Roman Catholic. That is, it's not merely a national church, it's an international one.</li>
								<li>Anglicans and many Presbyterians held what I'm calling the Strong position, favoring a national church unique to England or at least not answerable to an international authority.</li>
								<li>Some Presbyterians at some times seemed to favor a national non-exclusive and non-compulsory church.</li>
								<li>Independents favored no national-level church at all.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								But keep in mind that a strong position on a national church didn't necessarily mean a strong position on church governance. Put another way, some (Lockyer quotes one Sir John Holland on p349) considered any church where the power to remove someone from church membership to be a civil matter and some to be a clerical matter, but both of those groups could consider consistent wanting a national church.
							</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							No, the Presbyterians didn't want bishops. But presbyterianism acknowledges and embraces a wide-area governance model, starting with presbyteries at the regional level, with a supra-church hierarchy that agrees upon acceptable practices and dogma for (and of) individual churches. This position occupied the middle ground on this issue during the Civil Wars, Commonwealth, and Protectorate, hence my placement and description.

						<h2>Tolerance</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Cromwell was for a certain amount and kind of religious tolerance, and credited unity with diversity as the source of some of the Army's key victories. Yet he didn't extend his tolerance to, say, Irish Catholics, whom, you'll remember, he and the New Model Army sent into a kind of slavery in Barbados by the thousands.
						</p>
						<p>
							It was a bit a case of "I'm tolerant of anyone else who is also upright and observant as I am."
						</p>
						<p>
							Intolerance continued to run rampant. Case in point: Quaker James Nayler convicted in 1656 of blasphemy, sentenced to be "branded, flogged, and have a hold bored through his tongue". (372) Because that description insufficiently captures the brutality of the intolerance I'm talking about, I'll elaborate: Nayler had a B branded on his forehead (for Blasphemy), was pilloried in London, whipped as he walked through London streets, had his tongue pierced with a hot iron, taken to Bristol (site of his offenses) and whipped in their streets as well, then put into imprisonment at hard labor.
						</p>
						<p>
							By 1650, Lockyer says, "the Elizabethan ideal of uniformity gave way to diversity &#8212; though Prayer-Book and Roman Catholic services were still officially proscribed." (361)

						<h2>Politicking</h2>
						<p>
							How is a government legitimate(d)? Who gets to change the ruler(s)? What constitutes a nation? "L'état, c'est moi," or "Vox populi, vox dei"? How much should it cost to run a country? Where do they get their wonderful toys?
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								Pertinent for many things, not least the 3rd Civil War. If Charles was king of a unified Great Britain as he thought he was, how can one smaller political component of it attack another?
							</p>
							<p>
								I'm going to focus a bit on the Army, since it was in charge for much of this time, and the Levellers, since they are interesting.

								<li>Defanged episcopacy</li>
								<li>No compulsory or set form of worship</li>
								<li>Parliamentary control over militia and officers for at least 10 years</li>

							<li>Trading monopoly restraint</li>

						<h2>Levellers &lt;3 Army</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								Well, quite a few Levellers were in the army. In any case, the Levellers and Army sympathisers published a joint document in 1647, <em>The Case of the Army Truly Stated</em>, combining Army military issues with Levellers' social democratic concerns. (353)

								Cromwell did not favor the Levellers.

						<h2>The High Cost of Fighting a War</h2>

							Parliament's monthly assessment topped out at £120,000 and only went as low as £60,000 after the peak and until the Restoration.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								Regular Parliamentary weekly assessment commenced 1642 (343)
							</p>
							<p>
								Lockyer notes that "Kent, to take one example, was paying more by way of the assessment every month than Ship Money had cost it in an entire year." (350)
							</p>
							<p>
								Not clear where the money went, as soldiers were constantly underpaid or unpaid.

						<h2>Who Won the Civil Wars?</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								For nearly a decade, it sure seemed like Cromwell and the New Model Army did, as well as religious diversity through benign neglect (if not exactly pluralism).
							</p>
							<p>
								But it seems to me that Lockyer sees the Cromwell period as aberrant, that Cromwell and the NMA won the war but lost the peace. For Lockyer, the key is in the mistake of executing Charles I and the instability brought on by such an extreme act.

						<h2>Three Reductive Ways of Reading the End</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>1. James I and Charles I overreached, and it took 18 years to redress.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>2. Parliament tried to govern, but kept getting thwarted by social conservatives and a dissembling autocrat.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>3. Parliament asserted under Charles I that they could govern better, but couldn't.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							I think Lockyer leans toward this final reading. I find his sense of relief at the arrival of Monck in London, the "return to normality on the old pattern," and the <em>Declaration of Breda</em> (4 April 1660) palpable.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Are You Better Off Than You Were 18 Years Ago?</h2>
						<p>
							England's not exactly back where it started, but there is some rough consensus among the voting population that
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Large standing armies are bad</li>
							<li>Limited mon-archies aren't so bad</li>
							<li>Stability is good</li>
							<li>Religious toleration &#8212; but not too much! &#8212; is good</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								Though Lockyer focuses predominantly on the elites, it's worth noting that the vast majority of the population did not go untouched by the events of this period.
							</p>
							<p>
								Regular depredations during nine continual years of warfare and (it seems to me) nine more years of restless underpaid (or unpaid) soldiers could not help but have formed many peoples' outlook on the nature of the state and its relationship with the people.
							</p>
							<p>
								Concerning religion, though, I read between Lockyer's lines to claim that a culture of tolerance &#8212; with all the caveats I attached to the word earlier &#8212; seems to have taken solid root, even as it existed side-by-side with the hegemony of a national church.
